# Brain-imaging-by-OMAG
Monkey brain imaging at stroke using OMAG
This is the project in collaboration with Dr. Yazdan's lab. The images from monkey brain cranial window were collected by Shaozhen Song on November 27th at Primate Research Center OR using SSOCT system. Line rate was 200 kHz, central wavelength was 1310 nm, the imaging field of view was 9x9 mm2 per image, and compiled images were 20x20 mm2. The laser light was used for stroke simulation. The images were collected before stroke (baseline image) and after the stroke (lesion images).
